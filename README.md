# ZwiftPower Power Meter vs. Smart Trainer analyzer

Jupyter Notebook for analyzing the power reading difference between power meters and smart trainers. 

My specific use case is to compare Tacx Neo generation 1 vs Wahoo Kickr smart trainers, but the script can be "easily" modified to investigate other correlations.

A live, interactive version is available at Binder ↓. Just follow the link, wait for the instace to load and open `zwiftpower-webscraping.ipynb`.
